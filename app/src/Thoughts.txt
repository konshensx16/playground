- Need to load the listings into a list when the search fragment is reached
- Create a method that searches inside the list for the currency searched for - doing this
- Profiler is not functioning yet i think, need to test it ASAP (Fetcher) - Working but not so great, i guess? could be improved
    - The fetchJson for the currencies (MainActivity) is taking around 1900 ms
    - The fetchJson for the listings (SearchFragment) is taking around 1400ms
- App crashes when typing in the search box (DEBUG)
