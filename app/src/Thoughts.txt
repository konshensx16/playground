- Need to load the listings into a list when the search fragment is reached
- Create a method that searches inside the list for the currency searched for -~ fixed, will be improved in the future
    - to get more result, for now will create a temp list and add corresponding search results to it, and then pass it to the adapter
    - PRBLMS of this approach:
        - the list is quite large (about 1800 item), each time i need clear the list and add the result to list
        - by each time i mean every time the user types a character in
- Profiler is not functioning yet i think, need to test it ASAP (Fetcher) - Working but not so great, i guess? could be improved
    - The fetchJson for the currencies (MainActivity) is taking around 1900 ms
    - The fetchJson for the listings (SearchFragment) is taking around 1400ms
- App crashes when typing in the search box (onTextChangeEvent) (DEBUG) -~ fixed
- Just implemented the search adapter and created the required layouts, currently -~ everything fixed
    the app crashes when the SearchFragment is loading, so this requires some attention -~ fixed
    - The app still crashes when the user types in more than 5 characters -~ fixed
    - The list is not being modified when input changes (change the way the adapter is notified about changes to DataSetChanged) -~ fixed
