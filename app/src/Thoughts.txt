- Need to load the listings into a list when the search fragment is reached
- Create a method that searches inside the list for the currency searched for -~ fixed, will be improved in the future
    - to get more result, for now will create a temp list and add corresponding search results to it, and then pass it to the adapter
    - PRBLMS of this approach:
        - the list is quite large (about 1800 item), each time i to need clear the list and add the result to list
        - by each time i mean every time the user types a character in
- Profiler is not functioning yet i think, need to test it ASAP (Fetcher) - Working but not so great, i guess? could be improved
    - The fetchJson for the currencies (MainActivity) is taking around 1900 ms
    - The fetchJson for the listings (SearchFragment) is taking around 1400ms
- App crashes when typing in the search box (onTextChangeEvent) (DEBUG) -~ fixed
- Just implemented the search adapter and created the required layouts, currently -~ everything fixed
    the app crashes when the SearchFragment is loading, so this requires some attention -~ fixed
    - The app still crashes when the user types in more than 5 characters -~ fixed
    - The list is not being modified when input changes (change the way the adapter is notified about changes to DataSetChanged) -~ fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Handle the click of each recyclerView item and redirect to the currency details activity -~ working
    - Problem is when accessing the currency details from the search, clicking the back arrow takes you to the main activity
        instead of the search page
- Change the text in the search_layout from recent search to the user input when typing something -~ fixed
- Display the number of results found -~ fixed

- Try to change the CurrencyDetails from an activity to a Fragment and load it in the FrameLayout - REQUIRES SOME ATTENTION
- I really need to get rid of the Toasts that were used for testing they're becoming a pain in the ass -~ fixed

- I wanna add some animation to the transition between fragments, the current animation is so dry

- Work on the recent searches functionality - DOING
    - NOTES: this is going to a lil bit complicated in terms of logic so what i'm thinking
        about doing instead is just display the global values of the market in there
        instead of recent search, it's almost 2AM which is not a great time to make decisions
